abstract="Spiking neural P systems with inhibitory synapses (ISN P systems, for short) are a class of discrete neural-like computing models, which are inspired by the way of biological neurons storing and processing information and communication by means of excited and inhibitory impulses. In this work, we prove that ISN P systems can compute and accept any set of Turing computable numbers by using one type of neurons, thus can achieve Turing universality. Such systems are called homogenous ISN P systems. The results give a positive answer to an open problem left in (Pan and P{\u{a}}un, Int J Comput Commun 4(3):273--282, 2009) that ``whether the number of types of neurons in universal SN P systems can be decreased by using inhibitory synapses''. The obtained result is optimal in the sense of having minimal number of types of neurons in Turing universal SN P systems.",

A result is associated with a computation as usual, in the form of the number of time units elapsed between the first two steps when the output neuron spikes.

abstract = "We consider here spiking neural P systems with a non-synchronized (i.e., asynchronous) use of rules: in any step, a neuron can apply or not apply its rules which are enabled by the number of spikes it contains (further spikes can come, thus changing the rules enabled in the next step). Because the time between two firings of the output neuron is now irrelevant, the result of a computation is the number of spikes sent out by the system, not the distance between certain spikes leaving the system. The additional non-determinism introduced in the functioning of the system by the non-synchronization is proved not to decrease the computing power in the case of using extended rules (several spikes can be produced by a rule). That is, we obtain again the equivalence with Turing machines (interpreted as generators of sets of (vectors of) numbers). However, this problem remains open for the case of standard spiking neural P systems, whose rules can only produce one spike. On the other hand we prove that asynchronous systems, with extended rules, and where each neuron is either bounded or unbounded, are not computationally complete. For these systems, the configuration reachability, membership (in terms of generated vectors), emptiness, infiniteness, and disjointness problems are shown to be decidable. However, containment and equivalence are undecidable."

These SNP systems are a class of computing devices recently introduced as a bridge between spiking neural nets and membrane computing. The general sequentiality of these systems was considered previously; now we focus on the sequentiality induced by the spike number: at each step, the neuron with the maximum (or minimum) number of spikes among the neurons that are active (can spike) will fire. This strategy corresponds to a global view of the whole network that makes the system sequential. We study the properties of this type of a restriction (i.e. considering the case of sequentiality induced by the function maximum defined on numbers of spikes as well as the case of the sequentiality induced by the function minimum similarly defined on numbers of spikes). Several universality results are obtained for the cases of maximum and minimum induced sequentiality."

 abstract = { Different biological processes take different times to be completed, which can also be influenced by many environmental factors. In this work, a realistic definition of nonsynchronized spiking neural P systems (SN P systems, for short) is considered: during the work of an SN P system, the execution times of spiking rules cannot be known exactly (i.e., they are arbitrary). In order to establish robust systems against the environmental factors, a special class of SN P systems, called time-free SN P systems, is introduced, which always produce the same computation result independent of the execution times of the rules. The universality of time-free SN P systems is investigated. It is proved that these P systems with extended rules (several spikes can be produced by a rule) are equivalent to register machines. However, if the number of spikes present in the system is bounded, then the power of time-free SN P systems falls, and in this case, a characterization of semilinear sets of natural numbers is obtained. }

With the price of weight on synapses, quite small universal spiking neural P systems can be constructed.

Asynchronous SN P systems are non-synchronized systems, where the use of spiking rules (even if they are enabled by the contents of neurons) is not obligatory. It remains open whether asynchronous SN P systems with standard spiking rules are equivalent with Turing machines. In this paper, with a biological inspiration (in order to achieve some specific biological functioning, neurons from the same functioning motif or community work synchronously to cooperate with each other), we introduce the notion of local synchronization into asynchronous SN P systems. The computation power of asynchronous SN P systems with local synchronization is investigated. Such systems consisting of general neurons (respectively, unbounded neurons) and using standard spiking rules are proved to be universal. Asynchronous SN P systems with local synchronization consisting of bounded neurons and using standard spiking rules characterize the semilinear sets of natural numbers. These results show that the local synchronization is useful, it provides some “programming capacity” useful for achieving a desired computation power."

Some features that SN P systems possess are attractive to fault diagnosis. However, handling fuzzy diagnosis knowledge and reasoning is required for many fault diagnosis applications. The lack of ability is a major problem of existing SN P systems when applying them to the fault diagnosis domain. Thus, we extend SN P systems by introducing some new ingredients (such as three types of neurons, fuzzy logic and new firing mechanism) and propose the fuzzy reasoning spiking neural P systems (FRSN P systems). The FRSN P systems are particularly suitable to model fuzzy production rules in a fuzzy diagnosis knowledge base and their reasoning process. Moreover, a parallel fuzzy reasoning algorithm based on FRSN P systems is developed according to neuron’s dynamic firing mechanism. Besides, a practical example of transformer fault diagnosis is used to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed FRSN P systems in fault diagnosis problem."

In such models, a neuron fires when its potential equals a given value (called a threshold). In this work, spiking neural P systems with thresholds (SNPT systems) are introduced, where a neuron fires not only when its potential equals the threshold but also when its potential is higher than the threshold. Two types of SNPT systems are investigated. In the first one, we consider that the firing of a neuron consumes part of the potential (the amount of potential consumed depends on the rule to be applied). In the second one, once a neuron fires, its potential vanishes (i.e., it is reset to zero). The computation power of the two types of SNPT systems is investigated. We prove that the systems of the former type can compute all Turing computable sets of numbers and the systems of the latter type characterize the family of semilinear sets of numbers. The results show that the firing mechanism of neurons has a crucial influence on the computation power of the SNPT systems, which also answers an open problem formulated in Wang, Hoogeboom, Pan, Păun, and Pérez-Jiménez (2010). }

During computations, at each step only one of the components can be active for the whole system and one of the enabled rules from this active component of each neuron fires. The switching between the components occurs under different cooperation strategies. This paper considers the terminating mode, in which the switching occurs when no rule is enabled in the active component of any neuron in the system. By introducing this new mechanism, the computational power of asynchronous and sequential SN P systems with standard rules is investigated.

In this letter, we consider a generalized way of using spiking rules by the sequential way and the exhaustive way: if a rule is used at some step, then at that step, it can be applied any possible number of times, nondeterministically chosen. The computational power of SN P systems with a generalized use of rules is investigated. Specifically, we prove that SN P systems with a generalized use of rules consisting of one neuron can characterize finite sets of numbers. If the systems consist of two neurons, then the computational power of such systems can be greatly improved, but not beyond generating semilinear sets of numbers. SN P systems with a generalized use of rules consisting of three neurons are proved to generate at least a non-semilinear set of numbers. In the case of allowing enough neurons, SN P systems with a generalized use of rules are computationally complete. These results show that the number of neurons is crucial for SN P systems with a generalized use of rules to achieve a desired computational power. }

In this work, the biological feature known as structural plasticity is introduced in the framework of SNP systems. Structural plasticity refers to synapse creation and deletion, thus changing the synapse graph. The "programming" therefore of a brain-like model, the SNP system with structural plasticity (SNPSP system), is based on how neurons connect to each other. SNPSP systems are also a partial answer to an open question on SNP systems with dynamism only for synapses. For both the accepting and generative modes, we prove that SNPSP systems are universal. Modifying SNPSP systems semantics, we introduce the spike saving mode and prove that universality is maintained. In saving mode, however, a deadlock state can arise, and we prove that reaching such a state is undecidable. Lastly, we provide one technique in order to use structural plasticity to solve a hard problem: a constant time, nondeterministic, and semi-uniform solution to the NP-complete problem Subset Sum.},

Different from the usual firing rules in SNP systems, the firing condition of an inhibitory rule not only depends on the state of the neuron associated with the rule but also is related to the states of other neurons. Moreover, from the perspective of topological structure, the new variant is shown as a directed graph with inhibitory arcs, and therefore seems to have more powerful control. The computational completeness of SNP-IR systems is discussed. In particular, it is proved that SNP-IR systems are Turing universal number accepting/generating devices. Moreover, we obtain a small universal function-computing device for SNP-IR systems consisting of 100 neurons."

This new strategy of using rules, which is called a generalized way of using rules, is applicable for both firing rules and forgetting rules. In SN P systems with generalized use of rules (SNGR P systems, for short), if a rule is used at some step, it can be applied any possible number of times, nondeterministically chosen.

Specifically, a universal SNGR P system is constructed, where each neuron contains at most 5 rules, and for each time each firing rule consumes at most 6 spikes and each forgetting rule removes at most 4 spikes. This result makes an improvement regarding to these related parameters, thus provides an answer to the open problem mentioned in original work. Moreover, with this improvement we can use less resources (neurons and spikes involved in the evolution of system) to construct universal SNGR P systems.},

abstract = "Spiking neural P systems (SN P systems) have been well established as a novel class of distributed parallel computing models. Some features that SN P systems possess are attractive to fault diagnosis. However, handling fuzzy diagnosis knowledge and reasoning is required for many fault diagnosis applications. The lack of ability is a major problem of existing SN P systems when applying them to the fault diagnosis domain. Thus, we extend SN P systems by introducing some new ingredients (such as three types of neurons, fuzzy logic and new firing mechanism) and propose the fuzzy reasoning spiking neural P systems (FRSN P systems). The FRSN P systems are particularly suitable to model fuzzy production rules in a fuzzy diagnosis knowledge base and their reasoning process. Moreover, a parallel fuzzy reasoning algorithm based on FRSN P systems is developed according to neuron’s dynamic firing mechanism. Besides, a practical example of transformer fault diagnosis is used to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed FRSN P systems in fault diagnosis problem."

abstract = "In this paper we continue previous studies on the computational efficiency of spiking neural P systems, under the assumption that some pre-computed resources of exponential size are given in advance. Specifically, we give a deterministic solution for each of two well known PSPACE-complete problems: QSAT and Q3SAT. In the case of QSAT, the answer to any instance of the problem is computed in a time which is linear with respect to both the number n of Boolean variables and the number m of clauses that compose the instance. As for Q3SAT, the answer is computed in a time which is at most cubic in the number n of Boolean variables."

This improves known results of this type where the construction was non-uniform, and/or was using various ingredients added to the initial definition of spiking neural P systems (the SN P systems as defined initially are called here ``standard''). However, in the {\$}{\$}{\{}{\backslash}tt Subset{\}}{\backslash},{\{}{\backslash}tt Sum{\}}{\$}{\$}case, a price to pay for this improvement is that the solution is obtained either in a time which depends on the value of the numbers involved in the problem, or by using a system whose size depends on the same values, or again by using complicated regular expressions. A uniform solution to 3-{\$}{\$}{\{}{\backslash}tt SAT{\}}{\$}{\$}is also provided, that works in constant time.},
