abstract="Spiking neural P (SNP) systems are a class of parallel, distributed, and nondeterministic computing models inspired by the spiking of biological neurons. In this work, the biological feature known as structural plasticity is introduced in the framework of SNP systems. Structural plasticity refers to synapse creation and deletion, thus changing the synapse graph. The ``programming'' therefore of a brain-like model, the SNP system with structural plasticity (SNPSP system), is based on how neurons connect to each other. SNPSP systems are also a partial answer to an open question on SNP systems with dynamism only for synapses. For both the accepting and generative modes, we prove that SNPSP systems are universal. Modifying SNPSP systems semantics, we introduce the spike saving mode and prove that universality is maintained. In saving mode, however, a deadlock state can arise, and we prove that reaching such a state is undecidable. Lastly, we provide one technique in order to use structural plasticity to solve a hard problem: a constant time, nondeterministic, and semi-uniform solution to the NP-complete problem Subset Sum.",

abstract="Spiking neural P systems with anti-spikes (ASN P systems, for short) are a class of neural-like computing models in membrane computing, which are inspired by neurons communication through both excitatory and inhibitory impulses (spikes). In this work, we consider a restricted variant of ASN P systems, called homogeneous ASN P systems, where any neuron has the same set of spiking and forgetting rules. As a result, we prove that such systems can achieve Turing completeness. Specifically, it is proved that two categories of pure form of spiking rules (for a spiking rule, if the language corresponding to the regular expression that controls its application is exactly the form of spikes consumed by the rule, then the rule is called pure) are sufficient to compute and accept the family of sets of Turing computable natural numbers.",
